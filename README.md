# Challenge_5 Pharmaceutical data

Analysis of pharmaceutical data. Using Pandas I  was able to create data frames using csv files and clean the data to do further analysis. Once my data frames were clean I was able to gerate statistics regarding the volume for each regimine and creat a summary data frame. From that summary data frame I created a bar chart, pie chart, box plots, and scatter plots to show verious information related to the trials.
